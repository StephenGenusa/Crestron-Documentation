# Bits and Bytes of Crestron Knowledge #

I am no longer involved in Crestron development. I studied Crestron, the company and their products, and worked with their devices as a programmer for about three years. I did a lot of off-hours experimentation, got involved with forensics around the same time, and I developed a lot of research material. Here is a small part of that material. Corrections, additions and pull-requests are welcome.
